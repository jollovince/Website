          <p>Odette Quesada is a legendary Filipina singer-songwriter whose music has defined the sound of love and romance in Original Pilipino Music (OPM).

          <p>The 1980s became a golden era for the music of Odette Quesada, as her songs were brought to life by some of the country’s biggest and brightest stars. The late Ric Segreto turned “<i>Don’t Know What to Do, Don’t Know What to Say</i>” into a monster hit that remains a classic today. Teen idol Raymond Lauchengco found back-to-back success with “<i>I Need You Back</i>” and “<i>Farewell</i>,” while the iconic youth film <i>Bagets</i> was immortalized by its theme song “<i>Growing Up</i>,” performed by Gary Valenciano — another unforgettable creation from Odette’s pen.</p>
