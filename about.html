singer-songwriter</h3>
        <h1><span>OD</span>ETTE <br>QUESADA</h1>

        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">O</span>dette Quesada is a legendary Filipina singer-songwriter whose music has
          defined the sound of love and romance in Original Pilipino Music (OPM). From the very beginning of her
          career in the 1980s, Odette Quesada established herself as a prolific songwriter with an exceptional
          gift for weaving heartfelt lyrics into timeless melodies.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">O</span>dette Quesada first gained national attention when she won second prize
          in the 1982 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop) amateur division for her song
          “Give Me a Chance,” performed by Ric Segreto. In 1983, Odette followed this with a monumental
          achievement—clinching the Grand Prize in the professional category at the 6th Metro Manila Popular
          Music Festival for “Till I Met You,” sung by Kuh Ledesma.
