      <h2>Odette Quesada recalls early career move that empowered her as artist</h2>

      <p>From <i>Till I Met You</i>, <i>Friend of Mine</i> to <i>Farewell</i> and <i>To Love Again</i>, Odette Quesada is responsible for hits that helped define Original Pilipino Music (OPM) in the ‘80s. The veteran singer-songwriter’s beloved songs have since become ageless after getting revived time and again in movies, commercials, and recordings.</p>

      <p>“When I was writing the songs, I didn’t have any inkling if anyone would like them. All of a sudden they’re recorded, then they become hits at that time and I thought, ‘Okay, they would probably have a shelf life of 10 years, then get revisited hopefully by the next generation,’” she recently said during a media interview with broadsheets.</p>

      <p>“But to actually have my songs continuously being played and sung because of karaoke, videoke, and YouTube, (the music is) staying alive as well. I can’t be any happier knowing that it’s gonna live on.</p>

      <p>“They’re my legacy and hopefully, it will be around for another 40 years,” she said.</p>

      <p>Odette’s music legacy — 40 years as a recording artist and 41 years as a composer — will be celebrated via <b>Odette Quesada All Hits: The 40th Anniversary Celebration</b> concert on Sept. 1 (Friday) at the Newport Performing Arts Theater of the Newport World Resorts in Pasay. Among her special guests are Kuh Ledesma, Martin Nievera, Regine Velasquez-Alcasid, Raymond Lauchengco, Bituin Escalante, and Arman Ferrer, plus Nina Campos as front act.</p>

      <p>As a singer, she was discovered by Vicor (now under Viva Communications) boss Vic del Rosario after he heard her demos.</p>

      <p>“He asked, have you ever thought of singing your own songs? I said no. But I’ve heard your demos,” sabi niya, “you could be like a Carole King, writing and singing your songs.” Sabi ko, sure, you want me to sing my songs, I’ll sing my songs. But wait until I buy a car because mag-popromote ako pero wala akong kotse,” Odette shared.</p>

      <p>“But he doesn’t even remember talking to me about it (laughs),” she mused. “I mentioned it to him when I met with him in L.A. and sabi ko, remember? That’s why you had me singing <i>Friend of Mine</i> (first single as a singer)… He has the ear for music.”</p>
