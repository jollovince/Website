      <p><b>MANILA, Philippines —</b> Ten years after her decision to reignite her performing career at age 50, Odette Quesada is riding high on the wave of an inspiring career resurgence armed only with a potent combination of self-penned OPM (Original Pilipino Music) hits, quick wit, and idiosyncratic performing savvy.</p>

      <p>As a singer, Odette, who turned 60 last Jan. 13, has had her share of signature singles like <i>Friend of Mine</i> and <i>Dito Lang.</i> But she’s even more prolific as a songwriter responsible for the hits of some of the country’s biggest recording artists — like Sharon Cuneta (<i>To Love Again</i>, <i>You’re the One</i>), Kuh Ledesma (<i>Till I Met You</i>, <i>A Long, Long Time Ago</i>), Ric Segreto (<i>Give Me a Chance</i>, <i>Don’t Know What to Do, Don’t Know What to Say</i>), Gary Valenciano (<i>Growing Up</i>), Raymond Lauchengco (<i>Farewell</i>, <i>I Need You Back</i>), Verni Varga (<i>Love Me Again</i>), and Ariel Rivera (<i>Ayoko Na Sana</i>).</p>

      <p>So it’s almost impossible to attend any of her concerts and not get lured into a rousing sing-along session — a feel-good viewer-performer interaction that transforms the concert-going experience into something that feels like a communal undertaking.</p>

      <p>Odette’s compositions, many of them written about 40 years ago, continue to serve her well because songs about romance and heartbreak have a way of resonating with hopeless romantics from different generations. They speak of universal truths and shared experiences that transcend time, gender, social status, or personal circumstance.</p>
