      <p><b>LOS ANGELES —</b> Filipino composer and songwriter Odette Quesada is known for her timeless hits that have become classics in the Philippine music scene. With a career spanning over four decades, her music continues to captivate audiences worldwide, transcending generations and leaving an indelible mark in the industry.</p>

      <p>Quesada marks her 40th anniversary milestone with <b>“Odette Quesada All Hits Concert Series”</b> on May 11 at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, California, and on May 12 at the Fox Theatre in Redwood City, California. Joining her on stage are special guests <b>Raymond Lauchengco, Felson Palad,</b> and <b>Jaya.</b></p>

      <p>In a recent media huddle to promote the back-to-back shows, <b>ABS-CBN International Head of Events Business Development Kerwin Du</b> said TFC’s goal in bringing events to the U.S. is to showcase world-class Filipino talents on the international stage. “We at TFC consider Miss Odette Quesada as a generational talent, having produced multiple hits since the 80s,” he said.</p>

      <p>With the overwhelming reaction and three sold-out shows in Manila last year, <b>AIP Entertainment Co-Founder Saripaz Villar</b> said they are thrilled to share this anniversary concert with Filipinos all over the world.</p>

      <p>Quesada’s enduring impact on the music industry and her ability to resonate with audiences across different eras is undeniable. Her body of work has inspired countless artists and continues to remind listeners of the beauty and depth of Original Pilipino Music.</p>
