      <p><b>CALIFORNIA, USA —</b> Two of Original Pilipino Music’s (OPM) most beloved icons are set to captivate audiences in the heart of California’s wine country. On <b>Friday, June 6, 2025</b>, at 8:00 p.m., the <b>Chumash Casino Resort</b> in Santa Ynez, California will host the U.S. kickoff of <b>“Love, Q&A”</b>, a concert series featuring award-winning songwriter <b>Odette Quesada</b> and multi-hyphenate performer <b>Ogie Alcasid.</b></p>

      <p>The event marks a rare onstage reunion for the two Filipino music legends, whose careers have shaped the sound of OPM for more than four decades. <i>“Love, Q&A”</i> is more than just a concert — it’s a celebration of timeless hits that continue to bring generations together through music.</p>

      <h3>A Night of Classics and Connection</h3>
      <p>Known for penning some of the most enduring anthems of love and longing — <i>“Till I Met You,” “Friend of Mine,” “To Love Again”</i> — Odette Quesada has built a remarkable legacy as one of the Philippines’ most respected songwriters. Her music defined the sound of young love in the 1980s and remains deeply cherished today.</p>

      <p>Joining her is <b>Ogie Alcasid</b>, the powerhouse balladeer and television personality behind OPM classics like <i>“Nandito Ako,” “Sa Kanya,”</i> and <i>“Kailangan Ko’y Ikaw.”</i> With his soulful voice, humor, and charm, Ogie adds his own energy and wit to every performance, complementing Odette’s heartfelt storytelling.</p>

      <p>Together, the duo promises an unforgettable night filled with melodic storytelling, heartwarming banter, and nostalgia. “This show is about bringing back the feelings that made these songs unforgettable,” Odette said in a recent interview. “It’s about reminding ourselves how music connects people.”</p>


      <p>“Love, Q&A” is produced by <b>TFC Events</b> and <b>AIP Entertainment</b>, following the success of Odette’s sold-out anniversary concerts in Manila last year. The U.S. leg will serve as the first stop in a series of shows planned across North America.</p>
