      <p>To this day, karaoke-loving Pinoys continue to listen or sing-along to Ric Segreto’s <i>“Don’t Know What to Do, Don’t Know What to Say”</i> and <i>“Give Me a Chance,”</i> Raymond Lauchengco’s <i>“I Need You Back”</i> and <i>“Farewell,”</i> Kuh Ledesma’s <i>“Till I Met You”</i> and <i>“A Long, Long Time Ago,”</i> Gary Valenciano’s <i>“Growing Up”</i> (from <i>Bagets</i>) and Odette’s very own signature hit, <i>“Friend of Mine.”</i></p>

      <p>Odette Quesada was only in her teens — maybe around 14, 15, or 16 — when she began writing songs that would eventually become some of OPM’s (Original Pilipino Music) best-loved and most enduring hits. Indeed, while they may have been written and recorded about four decades ago, many of her songs have easily stood the test of time.</p>

      <p>To this day, karaoke-loving Pinoys continue to listen or sing-along to Ric Segreto’s <i>“Don’t Know What to Do, Don’t Know What to Say”</i> and <i>“Give Me a Chance,”</i> Raymond Lauchengco’s <i>“I Need You Back”</i> and <i>“Farewell,”</i> Kuh Ledesma’s <i>“Till I Met You”</i> and <i>“A Long, Long Time Ago,”</i> Gary Valenciano’s <i>“Growing Up”</i> (from <i>Bagets</i>) and Odette’s very own signature hit, <i>“Friend of Mine.”</i></p>

      <p>The aforementioned lineup wouldn’t be complete without mentioning another karaoke staple that has become Odette’s personal favorite over time.</p>

      <p>The articulate and quick-witted US-based singer-songwriter didn’t really write them with the top of the pop charts in mind. “When I was writing them, I didn’t have any inkling if anyone would like them at all,” said Odette when we spoke to her last week. “I thought they’d have a shelf life of probably 10 years, and hoped they’d get revisited by the next generation somehow.”</p>

      <p>“But to actually have my songs continuously being played because of videoke, karaoke, or YouTube… that’s truly special. These things, as well as the Pinoys’ penchant for love songs, keep them alive and well. I can’t be any happier knowing that they’re going to live on long after I’ve passed on.”</p>
