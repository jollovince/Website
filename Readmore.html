          <h2>40-year milestone: Odette Quesada takes stock of her musical legacy</h2>
          <p class="news-date">Published: August 28, 2023</p>
          <p>Odette Quesada was only in her teens — maybe around 14, 15, or 16 — when she began writing songs that would eventually become some of OPM’s (Original Pilipino Music) best-loved and most enduring hits. Indeed, while they may have been written and recorded about four decades ago, many of her songs have easily stood the test of time.</p>

          <h2>Odette at 60: Evolving musicality showcased in birthday concert</h2>
          <p class="news-date">Published: January 28, 2025</p>
          <p>Odette Quesada’s compositions — many of them written about 40 years ago — continue to serve her well because songs about romance and heartbreak have a way of resonating with hopeless romantics from different generations. What makes her reenergized popularity even more impressive is how her songs have kept her in the limelight even after she reluctantly decided to migrate to the United States in 2001 with her husband, fellow hitmaker Bodgie Basig (Sana Dalawa ang Puso Ko, Ale), who succumbed to cancer in 2012.</p>

          <p class="news-date">Published: November 22, 2023</p>
          <p>If you think only foreign artists or dreamy K-pop idols can make a killing on the local concert scene, you’ve got another thing coming. In fact, Odette Quesada’s anniversary concert at the Newport Performing Arts Theater last Sept. 1 was already a sold-out star-studded affair long before we interviewed the well-loved singer-songwriter—and exceptional performer, we must add—last Aug. 19.</p>
